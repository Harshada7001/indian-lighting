LITERATURE SURVEY Depression is a multifaceted mental health condition that extends far beyond feelings of sadness [1].<br /><br /></span><span id="n51" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> It manifests as a persistent lack of interest in previously enjoyable activities, coupled with a profound sense of hopelessness and despair.</span><span id="n52" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> This condition disrupts not only how individuals feel but also how they think and act, often leading to significant challenges in daily life.</span><span id="n6" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> Research into the automated detection of depression has primarily leveraged data collected through crowdsourcing, targeting individuals who have reported receiving</span><span id="n6" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> treatment for clinical depression. One widely used method involves analyzing words and word n-grams as features in traditional classification algorithms.<br /><br /></span><span id="n55" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> The objective is to identify patterns in the language of individuals with depression by comparing their vocabulary to that of healthy users.</span><span id="n6" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> However, this approach faces limitations, particularly due to the substantial overlap in the vocabulary used by both groups, making precise differentiation challenging.</span><span id="n57" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> Another approach involves the use of the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) framework [2], which classifies text into psychologically meaningful categories</span><span id="n58" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> such as social connections, cognitive styles, and individual differences.<br /><br /></span><span id="n59" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> While this method has enhanced understanding of mental health through psychological profiling, its ability to outperform basic word-based analysis remains marginal.</span><span id="n60" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> Recent advancements have combined LIWC-based features with deep learning models, such as LSTM and CNN, as part of ensemble techniques.</span><span id="n61" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> These integrations have significantly improved detection accuracy, demonstrating the potential of hybrid approaches in identifying depression.</span><span id="n62" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> In addition to linguistic analysis, researchers are exploring natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze content like suicide notes.<br /><br /></span><span id="n6" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> Studies comparing the classification accuracy of NLP algorithms with mental health professionals have highlighted NLP’s potential in identifying individuals at risk.</span><span id="n64" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> Automated systems using social media data are also emerging as effective tools for detecting mental health conditions.</span><span id="n65" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> Platforms like Twitter and Facebook serve as rich data sources, offering insights into linguistic patterns, emotional cues, and behavioral trends indicative of depression</span><span id="n6" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> or other disorders.<br /><br /></span><span id="n67" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> These systems, capable of large-scale monitoring, can provide real-time assessments of users' mental states, enabling early intervention and complementing traditional</span><span id="n68" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> diagnostic methods. Subtle changes in language tone, increased negativity, or reduced social engagement often serve as red flags for emerging mental health issues.</span><span id="n6" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> Integrating such technologies into existing healthcare frameworks holds promise for more comprehensive mental health support.</span><span id="n70" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> However, the ethical implications of using personal data for mental health monitoring must be addressed.<br /><br /></span><span id="n71" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> Issues like consent, data security, and the risk of misuse must be carefully managed to ensure user privacy.</span><span id="n72" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> Balancing the benefits of early detection with the need to protect individual rights will be critical as these technologies evolve.</span><span id="n73" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> In the case of other mental disorders, such as anorexia, similar methods are being applied to understand emotional patterns and behavioral indicators.</span><span id="n6" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> Millions worldwide suffer from conditions like anorexia [3], which profoundly impact their thoughts and behaviors, patterns, and conduct.<br /><br /></span><span id="n75" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> Detecting these issues early is challenging but essential, as it opens the opportunity to provide help before the condition worsens [4].</span><span id="n76" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> One way to achieve this is by monitoring how people express themselves—specifically, what and how they write, or even further, the emotions they convey through their</span><span id="n77" class="tooltip red_selection" title=" "> user activity on social media.</span><span id="n78" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> This approach involves identifying two computational representations designed to capture both the presence and the evolution of emotions expressed by social media</span><span id="n6" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> users. Our implementation leverages two recent public datasets centered on two significant mental disorders: depression and anorexia.<br /><br /></span><span id="n80" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> One widely used method involves static and dynamic representations, both referred to as BoSE, which are based on two key hypotheses.</span><span id="n81" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> Our first hypothesis suggests that broad emotional categories within lexicons may fail to adequately capture the intricate and often highly informative nuances of</span><span id="n6" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> a user's mental health.</span><span id="n6" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> For instance, the lexicon for the emotion "anger" includes words like "furious," "angry," and "upset," which represent different intensities of anger, but they are</span><span id="n6" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> all marked with the same surprise.<br /><br /></span><span id="n85" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> To address this, we propose representing each user with a histogram of sub-emotions, which are identified by clustering the word embeddings within broad emotional</span><span id="n6" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> categories. The second hypothesis is that individuals with depression and anorexia tend to display greater emotional variability than healthy individuals.</span><span id="n87" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> In this case, we represent each user with a set of statistical values that describe how the frequency of these sub-emotions changes over time.</span><span id="n88" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> The results suggest that the presence and variability of emotions captured by these representations provide valuable insights into social media users suffering from</span><span id="n6" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> depression or anorexia.<br /><br /></span><span id="n6" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> Additionally, combining both representations enhances performance, matching the best-reported approach for depression and falling only 1% behind the top-performing</span><span id="n6" class="tooltip null_selection" title=" "> approach for illness.
